I am currently a second year Ph.D student in the School of Computing, Clemson University. My research interests include IoT security/privacy and data science. Specifically, my work is focused on exploring the security and privacy of Voice Personal Assistants (VPA), such as Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.
